A Gravity Simulator

A rather complex Java program I wrote for my final exams.
Its goal is to accurately simulate the movement of different sky objects under the gravitational force.
The program has the ability to load and safe planet configurations and you can also adjust a lot of simulation 
settings such as timestep, render path and many more.

I have been working on the project for over a year now and the current major version has been in development for about three months. 
There have been previous approaches but they were promptly scrapped when I realised there was a better way to do it. 
The current approach will hopefully be the last one and will in the end be a great physics tool, perhaps even for educational usage, 
which can accurately simulate planet behaviour and is able to be customized in many ways. 


Key Features:

    Drop planets with different mass and initial velocity in the simulation space
    Simulate them under certain settings such as timestep or even a custom gravitational equation
    Examine the paths of the moving planets and take screen shots of them
    Save your custom planet configuration to load them later again
    Manipulate your saved configurations to for example mimic our solar system's

Navigation controls:

    Mouse wheel (+L_Shift): Adjust scale (e.g 1:500m)
    L_CTRL + left click drag: Navigate on the x/y-axis
